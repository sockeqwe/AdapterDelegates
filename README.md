## Idea
The idea of this library is to build your adapters by composing reusable components.

> Favor composition over inheritance

The idea is that you define an `AdapterDelegate` for each view type. This delegate is responsible for creating ViewHolder and binding ViewHolder for a certain viewtype.
An `AdapterDelegate` get added to an `AdapterDelegatesManager`. This manager is the man in the middle between `RecyclerView.Adapter` and each `AdapterDelegate`.

For example:
```java
public class CatAdapterDelegate extends AdapterDelegate<List<Animal>> {

  private LayoutInflater inflater;

  public CatAdapterDelegate(Activity activity) {
    inflater = activity.getLayoutInflater();
  }

  @Override public boolean isForViewType(@NonNull List<Animal> items, int position) {
    return items.get(position) instanceof Cat;
  }

  @NonNull @Override public RecyclerView.ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent) {
    return new CatViewHolder(inflater.inflate(R.layout.item_cat, parent, false));
  }

  @Override public void onBindViewHolder(@NonNull List<Animal> items, int position,
      @NonNull RecyclerView.ViewHolder holder, @Nullable List<Object> payloads) {

    CatViewHolder vh = (CatViewHolder) holder;
    Cat cat = (Cat) items.get(position);

    vh.name.setText(cat.getName());
  }

  static class CatViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {

    public TextView name;

    public CatViewHolder(View itemView) {
      super(itemView);
      name = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.name);
    }
  }
}
```

Please note that `onBindViewHolder()` last parameter `payloads` is null unless you use from `adapter.notify`.  There are more methods like `onViewRecycled(ViewHolder)`, `onFailedToRecycleView(ViewHolder)`,
`onViewAttachedToWindow(ViewHolder)` and `onViewDetachedFromWindow(ViewHolder)` you can override in your `AdapterDelegate` class.


Then an `AnimalAdapter` could look like this:

```java
public class AnimalAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter {

  private AdapterDelegatesManager<List<Animal>> delegatesManager;
  private List<Animal> items;

  public AnimalAdapter(Activity activity, List<Animal> items) {
    this.items = items;

    delegatesManager = new AdapterDelegatesManager<>();

    // AdapterDelegatesManager internally assigns view types integers
    delegatesManager.addDelegate(new CatAdapterDelegate(activity))
                    .addDelegate(new DogAdapterDelegate(activity))
                    .addDelegate(new GeckoAdapterDelegate(activity));

    // You can explicitly assign integer view type if you want to
    delegatesManager.addDelegate(23, new SnakeAdapterDelegate(activity));
  }

  @Override public int getItemViewType(int position) {
    return delegatesManager.getItemViewType(items, position);
  }

  @Override public RecyclerView.ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {
    return delegatesManager.onCreateViewHolder(parent, viewType);
  }

  @Override public void onBindViewHolder(RecyclerView.ViewHolder holder, int position) {
    delegatesManager.onBindViewHolder(items, position, holder);
  }

  @Override public int getItemCount() {
    return items.size();
  }
}
```

## Reducing boilerplate code
As you have seen in the code snippet above this may require to write the same boiler plate code again and again to hook in `AdapterDelegatesManager` to `Adapter`.
This can be reduced by extending either from `ListDelegationAdapter` if the data source the adapter displays is `java.util.List<?>` or `AbsDelegationAdapter` which is a more general one (not limited to `java.util.List`)

#### ListDelegationAdapter
For example the same `AnimalAdapter` from above could be simplified as follows by extending from `ListDelegationAdapter`:

```java
public class AnimalAdapter extends ListDelegationAdapter<List<Animal>> {

  public AnimalAdapter(Activity activity, List<Animal> items) {

    // DelegatesManager is a protected Field in ListDelegationAdapter
    delegatesManager.addDelegate(new CatAdapterDelegate(activity))
                    .addDelegate(new DogAdapterDelegate(activity))
                    .addDelegate(new GeckoAdapterDelegate(activity))
                    .addDelegate(23, new SnakeAdapterDelegate(activity));

    // Set the items from super class.
    setItems(items);
  }
}
```
#### AbsListItemAdapterDelegate
Also you may have noticed that you often have to write boilerplate code to cast items and ViewHolders when working with list of items as adapters dataset source.
`AbsListItemAdapterDelegate` can help you here. Let's take this class to create a `CatListItemAdapterDelegate` similar to the `CatAdapterDelegate` from top of this page but without the code for casting items.

```java
public class CatListItemAdapterDelegate extends AbsListItemAdapterDelegate<Cat, Animal, CatViewHolder> {

  private LayoutInflater inflater;

  public CatAdapterDelegate(Activity activity) {
    inflater = activity.getLayoutInflater();
  }

  @Override public boolean isForViewType(Animal item, List<Animal> items, int position) {
    return item instanceof Cat;
  }

  @Override public CatViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent) {
    return new CatViewHolder(inflater.inflate(R.layout.item_cat, parent, false));
  }

  @Override public void onBindViewHolder(Cat item, CatViewHolder vh, @Nullable List<Object> payloads) {
    vh.name.setText(item.getName());
  }

  static class CatViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {

    public TextView name;

    public CatViewHolder(View itemView) {
      super(itemView);
      name = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.name);
    }
  }
}
```

As you see, instead of writing code that casts list item to Cat we can use `AbsListItemAdapterDelegate` to do the same job (by declaring generic types).

## DiffUtil & ListAdapter = AsyncListDifferDelegationAdapter
Support library 27.0.1 introduced `ListAdapter` - the new extension of `RecyclerView.Adapter` that uses `AsyncListDiffer` internally. It does calculating diff in the background thread by default and does all particular animations for you items collection. Hence you don't need carry about `notify*` methods, `AsyncListDiffer` does all the job for you. And AdapterDelegates supports it too. 

This library offers the equivalent to `ListAdapter` which is called `AsyncListDifferDelegationAdapter` that can be used together with any regular `AdapterDelegate`.

```java
public class DiffAdapter extends AsyncListDifferDelegationAdapter<DiffItem> {
    public DiffAdapter() {
        delegatesManager
            .addDelegate(new DogAdapterDelegate());
            .addDelegate(new CatAdapterDelegate());
    }
}
```

## Fallback AdapterDelegate
What if your adapter's data source contains a certain element you don't have registered an `AdapterDelegate` for? In this case the `AdapterDelegateManager` will throw an exception at runtime. However, this is not always what you want. You can specify a fallback `AdapterDelegate` that will be used if no other `AdapterDelegate` has been found to handle a certain view type.

```java
AdapterDelegate fallbackDelegate = ...;
adapterDelegateManager.setFallbackDelegate( fallbackDelegate );
```
Note also that boolean return type of `isForViewType()` of a fallback delegate will be ignored (will not be take into account). So it doesn't matter if you return true or false. You can use `AbsFallbackAdapterDelegate` that already implements `isForViewType()` so that you only have to override `onCreateViewHolder()` and `onBindViewHolder()` for your fallback adapter delegate.


## Migrating from `2.x` to `3.0`
In contrast to `2.x` in `3.0` `AdapterDelegate` is no longer a interface, but rather an abstract class.
To keep version backward compatible with project that are already using `1.x` or `2.x` the package has been renamed to `com.hannesdorfmann.adapterdelegates3` and also the artifact id has been renamed to `adapterdelegates3`.

See the [releases section](https://github.com/sockeqwe/AdapterDelegates/releases) for more information about changes.
