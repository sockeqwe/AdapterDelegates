   * fallen out of visibility or a set of cached views represented by views still
   * attached to the parent RecyclerView. If an item view has large or expensive data
   * bound to it such as large bitmaps, this may be a good place to release those
   * resources.</p>
   * <p>
   * RecyclerView calls this method right before clearing ViewHolder's internal data and
   * sending it to RecycledViewPool. This way, if ViewHolder was holding valid information
   * before being recycled, you can call {@link RecyclerView.ViewHolder#getAdapterPosition()} to
   * get
   * its adapter position.

   * Called by the RecyclerView if a ViewHolder created by this Adapter cannot be recycled
   * due to its transient state. Upon receiving this callback, Adapter can clear the
   * animation(s) that effect the View's transient state and return <code>true</code> so that
   * the View can be recycled. Keep in mind that the View in question is already removed from
   * the RecyclerView.
   * <p>
   * In some cases, it is acceptable to recycle a View although it has transient state. Most
   * of the time, this is a case where the transient state will be cleared in
   * {@link RecyclerView.Adapter#onBindViewHolder(RecyclerView.ViewHolder, int)} call when View is
   * rebound to a new position.
   * For this reason, RecyclerView leaves the decision to the Adapter and uses the return
   * value of this method to decide whether the View should be recycled or not.
   * <p>
   * Note that when all animations are created by {@link RecyclerView.ItemAnimator}, you
   * should never receive this callback because RecyclerView keeps those Views as children
   * until their animations are complete. This callback is useful when children of the item
   * views create animations which may not be easy to implement using an {@link
   * RecyclerView.ItemAnimator}.
   * <p>
   * You should <em>never</em> fix this issue by calling
   * <code>holder.itemView.setHasTransientState(false);</code> unless you've previously called
   * <code>holder.itemView.setHasTransientState(true);</code>. Each
   * <code>View.setHasTransientState(true)</code> call must be matched by a
   * <code>View.setHasTransientState(false)</code> call, otherwise, the state of the View
   * may become inconsistent. You should always prefer to end or cancel animations that are
   * triggering the transient state instead of handling it manually.
   *
   * @param holder The ViewHolder containing the View that could not be recycled due to its
   * transient state.
   * @return True if the View should be recycled, false otherwise. Note that if this method
   * returns <code>true</code>, RecyclerView <em>will ignore</em> the transient state of
   * the View and recycle it regardless. If this method returns <code>false</code>,
   * RecyclerView will check the View's transient state again before giving a final decision.
   * Default implementation returns false.
